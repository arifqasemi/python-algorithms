1. Understand the Problem
Read the Problem Statement Carefully: Ensure you understand what is being asked. Pay attention to the input format, output format, and constraints.
Identify the Type of Problem: Determine if it involves searching, sorting, dynamic programming, graph traversal, etc.
2. Break Down the Problem
Example and Edge Cases: Work through examples and edge cases manually to understand the problem better.
Identify Patterns: Look for patterns or similarities with problems you have solved before.
3. Plan Your Approach
Choose the Right Data Structure: Based on the problem, decide which data structure would be most efficient.
Algorithm Choice: Determine which algorithm will solve the problem efficiently within the given constraints.
4. Pseudocode
Write Pseudocode: Before jumping into coding, outline your approach in pseudocode. This helps clarify your thoughts and structure your solution logically.
5. Implement the Solution
Translate Pseudocode to Code: Start coding based on your pseudocode. Break it into manageable functions if needed.
Write Clean Code: Use meaningful variable names and keep your code organized.
6. Test Your Solution
Run Provided Test Cases: Ensure your solution passes the given test cases.
Add Edge Cases: Test your solution against additional edge cases and large inputs to verify its robustness.
7. Debugging
Use Print Statements: If your code doesn't work as expected, use print statements to debug and track variables' values.
Debug Step-by-Step: Use a debugger to step through your code and identify where it goes wrong.
